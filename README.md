# Mantel Log Processing Task

My answers to this task can be found in the `code` folder, in a .ipynb file named 'Answer Sheet'.

You can see the answers displayed in Github, but if you want to run the code yourself, you can clone the repository, open either Jupyter Notebook or VSCode from that directory (to make sure the path works), and click 'Run All'.

I've left my deprecated code at the bottom, to make it easier to illustrate what I attempted first / how I tried to solve the problem.
